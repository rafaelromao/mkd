# MKD - A Markdown Documentation Framework

This is a simple framework for creating markdown-based documentation websites.

## How to Use

- **Clone this repository.**
- **Fill in the `index.md` file with your documentation.** You can use the existing file as a template.
- **Replace and add more images** in the `img` folder.
- **Replace the Google Analytics ID** in the html file.
- **Replace the Github star button repo** in the html file.
- **Delete the `scripts.js` and `styles.css` files.** These are now fetched from a CDN.
- **Add this folder to your project repo** and configure your GitHub Pages.

That's it! Your documentation website is ready.
